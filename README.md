# ReadDocs

ReadDocs is a browser extension which reads the code documentations for you, so you can find necessary information faster and get code snippets instantly.

I am building this in public at https://twitter.com/abrarfairuj

## Features

ReadDocs is pretty straightforward. It's a simple interface which you can pull up from top and ask any question immediately about the currently opened documentation page.

## Ditch Docs

ReadDocs is a free tool beside [SupaCodes](https://supacodes.com). Supacodes can automatically generate & update internal code documentations right in Github. If you are working in teams, ditch the docs hassle with Supacodes and ReadDocs. ReadDocs uses Supacodes to document its source files.
